// This package is a pretty "silly" example of an actor transport implementation.
// The general outline of components, where resolves and decode/encodes happen
// is approximately the same as in a real implementation, however several shortcuts
// and simplifications were taken to keep the example simple and easier to follow.
//
// The connection management and general HTTP server/client use in this transport
// is not optimal - far from it - and please take care to not copy this implementation
// directly, but rather use it as an inspiration for what COULD be done using this
// language feature.
